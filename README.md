# osCommerce Scrumble

Scripts and modules to tack onto osCommerce for various reasons.

Each module or script will be in its own folder with the relevant files necessary to 
explain what it would be used for and/or how to install it. 

- [Repatriator](/repatriator) - Fixes up address book entries where the country ID
  is incorrect 

## Caveat

All these modules are really only targeted to the poor souls using osCommerce v2.3.
