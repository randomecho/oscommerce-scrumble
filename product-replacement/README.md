# Product replacement 

Allows you to redirect customers from one product to its successor or a
specified replacement.

Handy when one product has been discontinued and replaced by something 
else you now sell, but the incoming links still point to the old item.


## Install

Follow the INSTALL file.

    
## Usage

Once installed, a new field appears when admin edits a product.

Select what other item in the catalogue will best serve customers
as a replacement.

When a customer visits via the link to the now discontinued item they
will be redirected to the successor item.

A warning message will appear notifying them of this redirect and that
the current item they have been redirected to is the replacement.

For example, you're an art store selling goran. Until you get a recall
notice and have to pull them from inventory. However, chalk is available
and works just the same. 

After you select chalk as the replacement to goran, any customers 
visiting the goran product URL will be redirected to the chalk item and
see the following on the page:

> /!\ Goran has been replaced by the following item.
> 
> Chalk                                       $19.76

## Caveat

Only works if you do not delete the discontinued or replaced product.
Simply mark it as "Out of Stock". Additionally, you can move it to a 
category hidden from public view.
