# Clean Slate module

Gives admin the power to just delete all the products and categories
in one fell swoop.

Useful if you want to start fresh but entering SQL directly at the 
database puts you off.


## Install

Follow the [install](./install.md) notes.

Or you can [upgrade](./upgrade.md) an existing osCommerce site.

    
## Usage

Once installed, a new page will be accessible from the Tools sidebar.

It will give you the option to:

- Delete all products
- Delete all categories


## Caveat

It's pretty destructive on your catalogue. So you may want to think
about it before installing it and/or running it on a live site.
